So they packed a nice basket for Little Red Riding Hood to take to her grandmother.\n","\n","When the basket was ready, the little girl put on her red cloak and kissed her mother goodbye.\n","\n","\"Remember, go straight to Grandma's house,\" her mother cautioned.  \"Don't dawdle along the way and please don't talk to strangers!  The woods are dangerous.\"\n","\n","\"Don't worry, mommy,\" said Little Red Riding Hood, \"I'll be careful.\"\n","\n","But when Little Red Riding Hood noticed some lovely flowers in the woods, she forgot her promise to her mother.  She picked a few, watched the butterflies flit about for awhile, listened to the frogs croaking and then picked a few more. \n","\n","Little Red Riding Hood was enjoying the warm summer day so much, that she didn't notice a dark shadow approaching out of the forest behind her...\n","\n","Suddenly, the wolf appeared beside her.\n","\n","\"What are you doing out here, little girl?\" the wolf asked in a voice as friendly as he could muster.\n","\n","\"I'm on my way to see my Grandma who lives through the forest, near the brook,\"  Little Red Riding Hood replied.\n","\n","Then she realized how late she was and quickly excused herself, rushing down the path to her Grandma's house. \n","\n","The wolf, in the meantime, took a shortcut...\n","\n","The wolf, a little out of breath from running, arrived at Grandma's and knocked lightly at the door.\n","\n","\"Oh thank goodness dear!

Poor Granny did not have time to say another word, before the wolf gobbled her up!\n","\n","The wolf let out a satisfied burp, and then poked through Granny's wardrobe to find a nightgown that he liked.  He added a frilly sleeping cap, and for good measure, dabbed some of Granny's perfume behind his pointy ears.\n","\n","A few minutes later, Red Riding Hood knocked on the door.  The wolf jumped into bed and pulled the covers over his nose.  \"Who is it?\" he called in a cackly voice.\n","\n","\"It's me, Little Red Riding Hood.\"\n","\n","\"Oh how lovely!

What big ears you have,\" said Little Red Riding Hood as she edged closer to the bed.\n","\n","\"The better to hear you with, my dear,\" replied the wolf.\n","\n","\"But Grandmother!
