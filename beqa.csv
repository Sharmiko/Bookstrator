The Fisher ,"A Fisher once took his bagpipes to the bank of a river, and played upon them with the hope of making the fish rise; but never a one put his nose out of the water. So he cast his net into the river and soon drew it forth filled with fish. Then he took his bagpipes again, and, as he played, the fish leapt up in the net. ‘Ah, you dance now when I play,’ said he.‘Yes,’ said an old Fish:‘When you are in a man’s power you must do as he bids you.’","A Fisher once took his bagpipes to the bank of a river, and played upon them with the hope of making the fish rise; but never a one put his nose out of the water."
The Shepherd’s Boy ,"There was once a young Shepherd Boy who tended his sheep at the foot of a mountain near a dark forest. It was rather lonely for him all day, so he thought upon a plan by which he could get a little company and some excitement. He rushed down towards the village calling out ‘Wolf, Wolf,’ and the villagers came out to meet him, and some of them stopped with him for a considerable time. This pleased the boy so much that a few days afterwards he tried the same trick, and again the villagers came to his help. But shortly after this a Wolf actually did come out from the forest, and began to worry the sheep, and the boy of course cried out ‘Wolf, Wolf,’ still louder than before. But this time the vil-lagers, who had been fooled twice before, thought the boy was again deceiving them, and nobody stirred to come to his help. So the Wolf made a good meal off the boy’s flock, and when the boy complained, the wise man of the village said:‘A liar will not be believed, even when he speaks the truth.’","There was once a young Shepherd Boy who tended his sheep at the foot of a mountain near a dark forest.

The Young Thief and His Mother,"A young Man had been caught in a daring act of theft and had been condemned to be executed for it. He expressed his desire to see his Mother, and to speak with her before he was led to execution, and of course this was granted. When his Mother came to him he said: ‘I want to whisper to you,’ and when she brought her ear near him, he nearly bit it off. All the bystanders were horrified, and asked him what he could mean by such brutal and inhuman conduct. ‘It is to punish her,’ he said. ‘When I was young I began with steal-ing little things, and brought them home to Mother. Instead of rebuking and punishing me, she laughed and said: ‘It will not be noticed.’ It is because of her that I am here to-day.’‘He is right, woman,’ said the Priest; ‘the Lord hath said:‘Train up a child in the way he should go; and when he is old he will not depart therefrom.’","A young Man had been caught in a daring act of theft and had been condemned to be executed for it. When his Mother came to him he said: ‘I want to whisper to you,’ and when she brought her ear near him, he nearly bit it off."
The Man and His Two Wives,"In the old days, when men were allowed to have many wives, a middle-aged Man had one wife that was old and one that was young; each loved him very much, and desired to see him like herself. Now the Man’s hair was turning grey, which the young Wife did not like, as it made him look too old for her husband. So every night she used to comb his hair and pick out the white ones. But the elder Wife saw her husband growing grey with great pleasure, for she did not like to be mistaken for his mother. So every morning she used to arrange his hair and pick out as many of the black ones as she could. The consequence was the Man soon found himself entirely bald.Yield to all and you will soon have nothing to yield.","In the old days, when men were allowed to have many wives, a middle-aged Man had one wife that was old and one that was young; each loved him very much, and desired to see him like herself."
The Nurse and the Wolf,"‘Be quiet now,’ said an old Nurse to a child sitting on her lap. ‘If you make that noise again I will throw you to the Wolf.’Now it chanced that a Wolf was passing close under the window as this was said. So he crouched down by the side of the house and waited. ‘I am in good luck to-day,’ thought he. ‘It is sure to cry soon, and a daintier morsel I haven’t had for many a long day.’ So he waited, and he waited, and he waited, till at last the child began to cry, and the Wolf came forward before the window, and looked up to the Nurse, wagging his tail. But all the Nurse did was to shut down the window and call for help, and the dogs of the house came rushing out. ‘Ah,’ said the Wolf as he galloped away,‘Enemies promises were made to be broken.’","‘Be quiet now,’ said an old Nurse to a child sitting on her lap. ‘ But all the Nurse did was to shut down the window and call for help, and the dogs of the house came rushing out. ‘"
The Tortoise and the Birds,"A Tortoise desired to change its place of residence, so he asked an Eagle to carry him to his new home, promising her a rich reward for her trouble. The Eagle agreed and seiz-ing the Tortoise by the shell with her talons soared aloft. On their way they met a Crow, who said to the Eagle: ‘Tor-toise is good eating.’ ‘The shell is too hard,’ said the Eagle in reply. ‘The rocks will soon crack the shell,’ was the Crow’s answer; and the Eagle, taking the hint, let fall the Tortoise on a sharp rock, and the two birds made a hearty meal of the Tortoise.Never soar aloft on an enemy’s pinions.","A Tortoise desired to change its place of residence, so he asked an Eagle to carry him to his new home, promising her a rich reward for her trouble.

The Two Crabs,"One fine day two Crabs came out from their home to take a stroll on the sand. ‘Child,’ said the mother, ‘you are walking very ungracefully. You should accustom yourself, to walk-ing straight forward without twisting from side to side.’‘Pray, mother,’ said the young one, ‘do but set the exam-ple yourself, and I will follow you.’Example is the best precept.","One fine day two Crabs came out from their home to take a stroll on the sand. ‘ ’‘Pray, mother,’ said the young one, ‘do but set the exam-ple yourself, and I will follow you."
The Ass in the Lion’s Skin,"An Ass once found a Lion’s skin which the hunters had left out in the sun to dry. He put it on and went towards his na-tive village. All fled at his approach, both men and animals, and he was a proud Ass that day. In his delight he lifted up his voice and brayed, but then every one knew him, and his owner came up and gave him a sound cudgelling for the fright he had caused. And shortly afterwards a Fox came up to him and said: ‘Ah, I knew you by your voice.’Fine clothes may disguise, but silly words will disclose a fool.","An Ass once found a Lion’s skin which the hunters had left out in the sun to dry.

The Two Fellows and the Bear,"Two Fellows were travelling together through a wood, when a Bear rushed out upon them. One of the travellers hap-pened to be in front, and he seized hold of the branch of a tree, and hid himself among the leaves. The other, seeing no help for it, threw himself flat down upon the ground, with his face in the dust. The Bear, coming up to him, put his muzzle close to his ear, and sniffed and sniffed. But at last with a growl he shook his head and slouched off, for bears will not touch dead meat. Then the fellow in the tree came down to his comrade, and, laughing, said ‘What was it that Master Bruin whispered to you?’‘He told me,’ said the other,‘Never trust a friend who deserts you at a pinch.’","Two Fellows were travelling together through a wood, when a Bear rushed out upon them.

The Two Pots,"Two Pots had been left on the bank of a river, one of brass, and one of earthenware. When the tide rose they both float-ed off down the stream. Now the earthenware pot tried its best to keep aloof from the brass one, which cried out: ‘Fear nothing, friend, I will not strike you.’‘But I may come in contact with you,’ said the other, ‘if I come too close; and whether I hit you, or you hit me, I shall suffer for it.’The strong and the weak cannot keep company.","Two Pots had been left on the bank of a river, one of brass, and one of earthenware."
The Four Oxen and the Lion,"A Lion used to prowl about a field in which Four Oxen used to dwell. Many a time he tried to attack them; but when-ever he came near they turned their tails to one another, so that whichever way he approached them he was met by the horns of one of them. At last, however, they fell a-quarrel-ling among themselves, and each went off to pasture alone in a separate corner of the field. Then the Lion attacked them one by one and soon made an end of all four.United we stand, divided we fall.","A Lion used to prowl about a field in which Four Oxen used to dwell.

The Fisher and the Little Fish ,"It happened that a Fisher, after fishing all day, caught only a little fish. ‘Pray, let me go, master,’ said the Fish. ‘I am much too small for your eating just now. If you put me back into the river I shall soon grow, then you can make a fine meal off me.’‘Nay, nay, my little Fish,’ said the Fisher, ‘I have you now. I may not catch you hereafter.’A little thing in hand is worth more than a great thing in prospect.","It happened that a Fisher, after fishing all day, caught only a little fish. ‘"
Avaricious and Envious,"Two neighbours came before Jupiter and prayed him to grant their hearts’ desire. Now the one was full of avarice, and the other eaten up with envy. So to punish them both, Jupiter granted that each might have whatever he wished for himself, but only on condition that his neighbour had twice as much. The Avaricious man prayed to have a room full of gold. No sooner said than done; but all his joy was turned to grief when he found that his neighbour had two rooms full of the precious metal. Then came the turn of the Envi-ous man, who could not bear to think that his neighbour had any joy at all. So he prayed that he might have one of his own eyes put out, by which means his companion would become totally blind.Vices are their own punishment.","Two neighbours came before Jupiter and prayed him to grant their hearts’ desire.

The Crow and the Pitcher,"A Crow, half-dead with thirst, came upon a Pitcher which had once been full of water; but when the Crow put its beak into the mouth of the Pitcher he found that only very little water was left in it, and that he could not reach far enough down to get at it. He tried, and he tried, but at last had to give up in despair. Then a thought came to him, and he took a pebble and dropped it into the Pitcher. Then he took an-other pebble and dropped it into the Pitcher. Then he took another pebble and dropped that into the Pitcher. Then he took another pebble and dropped that into the Pitch-er. Then he took another pebble and dropped that into the Pitcher. Then he took another pebble and dropped that into the Pitcher. At last, at last, he saw the water mount up near him, and after casting in a few more pebbles he was able to quench his thirst and save his life.Little by little does the trick.","A Crow, half-dead with thirst, came upon a Pitcher which had once been full of water; but when the Crow put its beak into the mouth of the Pitcher he found that only very little water was left in it, and that he could not reach far enough down to get at it.

The Man and the Satyr,"A Man had lost his way in a wood one bitter winter’s night. As he was roaming about, a Satyr came up to him, and find-ing that he had lost his way, promised to give him a lodging for the night, and guide him out of the forest in the morn-ing. As he went along to the Satyr’s cell, the Man raised both his hands to his mouth and kept on blowing at them. ‘What do you do that for?’ said the Satyr.‘My hands are numb with the cold,’ said the Man, ‘and my breath warms them.’After this they arrived at the Satyr’s home, and soon the Satyr put a smoking dish of porridge before him. But when the Man raised his spoon to his mouth he began blowing upon it. ‘And what do you do that for?’ said the Satyr.‘The porridge is too hot, and my breath will cool it.’‘Out you go,’ said the Satyr. ‘I will have nought to do with a man who can blow hot and cold with the same breath.’","A Man had lost his way in a wood one bitter winter’s night.

The Goose With the Golden Eggs ,"One day a countryman going to the nest of his Goose found there an egg all yellow and glittering. When he took it up it was as heavy as lead and he was going to throw it away, because he thought a trick had been played upon him. But he took it home on second thoughts, and soon found to his delight that it was an egg of pure gold. Every morning the same thing occurred, and he soon became rich by selling his eggs. As he grew rich he grew greedy; and thinking to get at once all the gold the Goose could give, he killed it and opened it only to find nothing.Greed oft o’er reaches itself.","One day a countryman going to the nest of his Goose found there an egg all yellow and glittering.

The Labourer and the Nightingale,"A Labourer lay listening to a Nightingale’s song throughout the summer night. So pleased was he with it that the next night he set a trap for it and captured it. ‘Now that I have caught thee,’ he cried, ‘thou shalt always sing to me.’‘We Nightingales never sing in a cage.’ said the bird.‘Then I’ll eat thee.’ said the Labourer. ‘I have always heard say that a nightingale on toast is dainty morsel.’‘Nay, kill me not,’ said the Nightingale; ‘but let me free, and I’ll tell thee three things far better worth than my poor body.’ The Labourer let him loose, and he flew up to a branch of a tree and said: ‘Never believe a captive’s promise; that’s one thing. Then again: Keep what you have. And third piece of advice is: Sorrow not over what is lost forever.’ Then the song-bird flew away.","A Labourer lay listening to a Nightingale’s song throughout the summer night. ’‘Nay, kill me not,’ said the Nightingale; ‘but let me free, and I’ll tell thee three things far better worth than my poor body.’"
"The Fox, the Cock, and the Dog","One moonlight night a Fox was prowling about a farmer’s hen-coop, and saw a Cock roosting high up beyond his reach. ‘Good news, good news!’ he cried.‘Why, what is that?’ said the Cock.‘King Lion has declared a universal truce. No beast may hurt a bird henceforth, but all shall dwell together in broth-erly friendship.’‘Why, that is good news,’ said the Cock; ‘and there I see some one coming, with whom we can share the good tid-ings.’ And so saying he craned his neck forward and looked afar off.‘What is it you see?’ said the Fox.‘It is only my master’s Dog that is coming towards us. What, going so soon?’ he continued, as the Fox began to turn away as soon as he had heard the news. ‘Will you not stop and congratulate the Dog on the reign of universal peace?’‘I would gladly do so,’ said the Fox, ‘but I fear he may not have heard of King Lion’s decree.’Cunning often outwits itself.","One moonlight night a Fox was prowling about a farmer’s hen-coop, and saw a Cock roosting high up beyond his reach. ‘ Will you not stop and congratulate the Dog on the reign of universal peace?’‘I would gladly do so,’ said the Fox, ‘but I fear he may not have heard of King Lion’s decree."
The Wind and the Sun,"The Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stron-ger. Suddenly they saw a traveller coming down the road, and the Sun said: ‘I see a way to decide our dispute. Which-ever of us can cause that traveller to take off his cloak shall be regarded as the stronger. You begin.’ So the Sun retired behind a cloud, and the Wind began to blow as hard as it could upon the traveller. But the harder he blew the more closely did the traveller wrap his cloak round him, till at last the Wind had to give up in despair. Then the Sun came out and shone in all his glory upon the traveller, who soon found it too hot to walk with his cloak on.Kindness effects more than severity.","The Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stron-ger.

Hercules and the Waggoner,"A Waggoner was once driving a heavy load along a very muddy way. At last he came to a part of the road where the wheels sank half-way into the mire, and the more the horses pulled, the deeper sank the wheels. So the Waggoner threw down his whip, and knelt down and prayed to Hercules the Strong. ‘O Hercules, help me in this my hour of distress,’ quoth he. But Hercules appeared to him, and said:‘Tut, man, don’t sprawl there. Get up and put your shoul-der to the wheel.’The gods help them that help themselves.","A Waggoner was once driving a heavy load along a very muddy way.
