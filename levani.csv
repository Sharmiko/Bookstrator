The Frog and the Ox,"‘Oh Father,’ said a little Frog to the big one sitting by the side of a pool, ‘I have seen such a terrible monster! It was as big as a mountain, with horns on its head, and a long tail, and it had hoofs divided in two.’‘Tush, child, tush,’ said the old Frog, ‘that was only Farm-er White’s Ox. It isn’t so big either; he may be a little bit taller than I, but I could easily make myself quite as broad; just you see.’ So he blew himself out, and blew himself out, and blew himself out. ‘Was he as big as that?’ asked he.‘Oh, much bigger than that,’ said the young Frog.Again the old one blew himself out, and asked the young one if the Ox was as big as that.‘Bigger, father, bigger,’ was the reply.So the Frog took a deep breath, and blew and blew and blew, and swelled and swelled and swelled. And then he said: ‘I’m sure the Ox is not as big asBut at this moment he burst.Self-conceit may lead to self-destruction.","‘Oh Father,’ said a little Frog to the big one sitting by the side of a pool, ‘I have seen such a terrible monster!

Androcles,"A slave named Androcles once escaped from his master and fled to the forest. As he was wandering about there he came upon a Lion lying down moaning and groaning. At first he turned to flee, but finding that the Lion did not pursue him, he turned back and went up to him. As he came near, the Lion put out his paw, which was all swollen and bleeding, and Androcles found that a huge thorn had got into it, and was causing all the pain. He pulled out the thorn and bound up the paw of the Lion, who was soon able to rise and lick the hand of Androcles like a dog. Then the Lion took An-drocles to his cave, and every day used to bring him meat from which to live. But shortly afterwards both Androcles and the Lion were captured, and the slave was sentenced to be thrown to the Lion, after the latter had been kept without food for several days. The Emperor and all his Court came to see the spectacle, and Androcles was led out into the middle of the arena. Soon the Lion was let loose from his den, and rushed bounding and roaring towards his victim. But as soon as he came near to Androcles he recognised his friend, and fawned upon him, and licked his hands like a friendly dog. The Emperor, surprised at this, summoned Androcles to him, who told him the whole story. Whereup-on the slave was pardoned and freed, and the Lion let loose to his native forest.Gratitude is the sign of noble souls.","A slave named Androcles once escaped from his master and fled to the forest.

"The Bat, the Birds, and the Beasts","A great conflict was about to come off between the Birds and the Beasts. When the two armies were collected togeth-er the Bat hesitated which to join. The Birds that passed his perch said: ‘Come with us”; but he said: ‘I am a Beast.’ Later on, some Beasts who were passing underneath him looked up and said: ‘Come with us”; but he said: ‘I am a Bird.’ Luck-ily at the last moment peace was made, and no battle took place, so the Bat came to the Birds and wished to join in the rejoicings, but they all turned against him and he had to fly away. He then went to the Beasts, but soon had to beat a re-treat, or else they would have torn him to pieces. ‘Ah,’ said the Bat, ‘I see now,‘He that is neither one thing nor the other has no friends.’","A great conflict was about to come off between the Birds and the Beasts.

The Hart and the Hunter,"The Hart was once drinking from a pool and admiring the noble figure he made there. ‘Ah,’ said he, ‘where can you see such noble horns as these, with such antlers! I wish I had legs more worthy to bear such a noble crown; it is a pity they are so slim and slight.’ At that moment a Hunter approached and sent an arrow whistling after him. Away bounded the Hart, and soon, by the aid of his nimble legs, was nearly out of sight of the Hunter; but not noticing where he was go-ing, he passed under some trees with branches growing low down in which his antlers were caught, so that the Hunter had time to come up. ‘Alas! alas!’ cried the Hart:‘We often despise what is most useful to us.’",The Hart was once drinking from a pool and admiring the noble figure he made there. ‘ I wish I had legs more worthy to bear such a noble crown; it is a pity they are so slim and slight.’
The Serpent and the File,A Serpent in the course of its wanderings came into an ar-mourer’s shop. As he glided over the floor he felt his skin pricked by a file lying there. In a rage he turned round upon it and tried to dart his fangs into it; but he could do no harm to heavy iron and had soon to give over his wrath.It is useless attacking the insensible.,A Serpent in the course of its wanderings came into an ar-mourer’s shop.
The Man and the Wood,"A Man came into a Wood one day with an axe in his hand, and begged all the Trees to give him a small branch which he wanted for a particular purpose. The Trees were good-natured and gave him one of their branches. What did the Man do but fix it into the axe head, and soon set to work cutting down tree after tree. Then the Trees saw how foolish they had been in giving their enemy the means of destroy-ing themselves.","A Man came into a Wood one day with an axe in his hand, and begged all the Trees to give him a small branch which he wanted for a particular purpose."
The Dog and the Wolf,"A gaunt Wolf was almost dead with hunger when he hap-pened to meet a House-dog who was passing by. ‘Ah, Cousin,’ said the Dog. ‘I knew how it would be; your irregular life will soon be the ruin of you. Why do you not work steadily as I do, and get your food regularly given to you?’‘I would have no objection,’ said the Wolf, ‘if I could only get a place.’‘I will easily arrange that for you,’ said the Dog; ‘come with me to my master and you shall share my work.’So the Wolf and the Dog went towards the town together. On the way there the Wolf noticed that the hair on a cer-tain part of the Dog’s neck was very much worn away, so he asked him how that had come about.‘Oh, it is nothing,’ said the Dog. ‘That is only the place where the collar is put on at night to keep me chained up; it chafes a bit, but one soon gets used to it.’‘Is that all?’ said the Wolf. ‘Then good-bye to you, Mas-ter Dog.’Better starve free than be a fat slave.","A gaunt Wolf was almost dead with hunger when he hap-pened to meet a House-dog who was passing by. ‘ That is only the place where the collar is put on at night to keep me chained up; it chafes a bit, but one soon gets used to it."
The Belly and the Members,"One fine day it occurred to the Members of the Body that they were doing all the work and the Belly was having all the food. So they held a meeting, and after a long discus-sion, decided to strike work till the Belly consented to take its proper share of the work. So for a day or two, the Hands refused to take the food, the Mouth refused to receive it, and the Teeth had no work to do. But after a day or two the Members began to find that they themselves were not in a very active condition: the Hands could hardly move, and the Mouth was all parched and dry, while the Legs were unable to support the rest. So thus they found that even the Belly in its dull quiet way was doing necessary work for the Body, and that all must work together or the Body will go to pieces.","One fine day it occurred to the Members of the Body that they were doing all the work and the Belly was having all the food.

The Hart in the Ox-Stall,"A Hart hotly pursued by the hounds fled for refuge into an ox-stall, and buried itself in a truss of hay, leaving nothing to be seen but the tips of his horns. Soon after the Hunters came up and asked if any one had seen the Hart. The stable boys, who had been resting after their dinner, looked round, but could see nothing, and the Hunters went away. Shortly afterwards the master came in, and looking round, saw that something unusual had taken place. He pointed to the truss of hay and said: ‘What are those two curious things sticking out of the hay?’ And when the stable boys came to look they discovered the Hart, and soon made an end of him. He thus learnt that Nothing escapes the master’s eye.","A Hart hotly pursued by the hounds fled for refuge into an ox-stall, and buried itself in a truss of hay, leaving nothing to be seen but the tips of his horns.

The Fox and the Grapes ,"One hot summer’s day a Fox was strolling through an or-chard till he came to a bunch of Grapes just ripening on a vine which had been trained over a lofty branch. ‘Just the thing to quench my thirst,’ quoth he. Drawing back a few paces, he took a run and a jump, and just missed the bunch. Turning round again with a One, Two, Three, he jumped up, but with no greater success. Again and again he tried after the tempting morsel, but at last had to give it up, and walked away with his nose in the air, saying: ‘I am sure they are sour.’It is easy to despise what you cannot get.","One hot summer’s day a Fox was strolling through an or-chard till he came to a bunch of Grapes just ripening on a vine which had been trained over a lofty branch. ‘ Again and again he tried after the tempting morsel, but at last had to give it up, and walked away with his nose in the air, saying: ‘I am sure they are sour."
"The Horse, Hunter, and Stag","A quarrel had arisen between the Horse and the Stag, so the Horse came to a Hunter to ask his help to take revenge on the Stag. The Hunter agreed, but said: ‘If you desire to con-quer the Stag, you must permit me to place this piece of iron between your jaws, so that I may guide you with these reins, and allow this saddle to be placed upon your back so that I may keep steady upon you as we follow after the enemy.’ The Horse agreed to the conditions, and the Hunter soon saddled and bridled him. Then with the aid of the Hunter the Horse soon overcame the Stag, and said to the Hunter: ‘Now, get off, and remove those things from my mouth and back.’‘Not so fast, friend,’ said the Hunter. ‘I have now got you under bit and spur, and prefer to keep you as you are at pres-ent.’If you allow men to use you for your own purposes, they will use you for theirs.","A quarrel had arisen between the Horse and the Stag, so the Horse came to a Hunter to ask his help to take revenge on the Stag.

The Peacock and Juno,"A Peacock once placed a petition before Juno desiring to have the voice of a nightingale in addition to his other at-tractions; but Juno refused his request. When he persisted, and pointed out that he was her favourite bird, she said:‘Be content with your lot; one cannot be first in every-thing.’",A Peacock once placed a petition before Juno desiring to have the voice of a nightingale in addition to his other at-tractions; but Juno refused his request.
The Fox and the Lion,"When first the Fox saw the Lion he was terribly frightened, and ran away and hid himself in the wood. Next time how-ever he came near the King of Beasts he stopped at a safe distance and watched him pass by. The third time they came near one another the Fox went straight up to the Lion and passed the time of day with him, asking him how his family were, and when he should have the pleasure of seeing him again; then turning his tail, he parted from the Lion without much ceremony.Familiarity breeds contempt.","When first the Fox saw the Lion he was terribly frightened, and ran away and hid himself in the wood.

The Lion and the Statue,"A Man and a Lion were discussing the relative strength of men and lions in general. The Man contended that he and his fellows were stronger than lions by reason of their great-er intelligence. ‘Come now with me,’ he cried, ‘and I will soon prove that I am right.’ So he took him into the public gardens and showed him a statue of Hercules overcoming the Lion and tearing his mouth in two.‘That is all very well,’ said the Lion, ‘but proves nothing, for it was a man who made the statue.’We can easily represent things as we wish them to be.",A Man and a Lion were discussing the relative strength of men and lions in general.

The Ant and the Grasshopper,"In a field one summer’s day a Grasshopper was hopping about, chirping and singing to its heart’s content. An Ant passed by, bearing along with great toil an ear of corn he was taking to the nest.‘Why not come and chat with me,’ said the Grasshopper, ‘instead of toiling and moiling in that way?’‘I am helping to lay up food for the winter,’ said the Ant, ‘and recommend you to do the same.’‘Why bother about winter?’ said the Grasshopper; we have got plenty of food at present.’ But the Ant went on its way and continued its toil. When the winter came the Grasshopper had no food and found itself dying of hunger, while it saw the ants distributing every day corn and grain from the stores they had collected in the summer. Then the Grasshopper knew:It is best to prepare for the days of necessity.","In a field one summer’s day a Grasshopper was hopping about, chirping and singing to its heart’s content.

The Tree and the Reed,"‘Well, little one,’ said a Tree to a Reed that was growing at its foot, ‘why do you not plant your feet deeply in the ground, and raise your head boldly in the air as I do?’‘I am contented with my lot,’ said the Reed. ‘I may not be so grand, but I think I am safer.’‘Safe!’ sneered the Tree. ‘Who shall pluck me up by the roots or bow my head to the ground?’ But it soon had to re-pent of its boasting, for a hurricane arose which tore it up from its roots, and cast it a useless log on the ground, while the little Reed, bending to the force of the wind, soon stood upright again when the storm had passed over.Obscurity often brings safety.","‘Well, little one,’ said a Tree to a Reed that was growing at its foot, ‘why do you not plant your feet deeply in the ground, and raise your head boldly in the air as I do?’‘I am contented with my lot,’ said the Reed. ‘"
The Fox and the Cat,"A Fox was boasting to a Cat of its clever devices for escap-ing its enemies. ‘I have a whole bag of tricks,’ he said, ‘which contains a hundred ways of escaping my enemies.’‘I have only one,’ said the Cat; ‘but I can generally man-age with that.’ Just at that moment they heard the cry of a pack of hounds coming towards them, and the Cat imme-diately scampered up a tree and hid herself in the boughs. ‘This is my plan,’ said the Cat. ‘What are you going to do?’ The Fox thought first of one way, then of another, and while he was debating the hounds came nearer and nearer, and at last the Fox in his confusion was caught up by the hounds and soon killed by the huntsmen. Miss Puss, who had been looking on, said:‘Better one safe way than a hundred on which you can-not reckon.’","A Fox was boasting to a Cat of its clever devices for escap-ing its enemies. ‘ Just at that moment they heard the cry of a pack of hounds coming towards them, and the Cat imme-diately scampered up a tree and hid herself in the boughs. ‘"
The Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing,"A Wolf found great difficulty in getting at the sheep owing to the vigilance of the shepherd and his dogs. But one day it found the skin of a sheep that had been flayed and thrown aside, so it put it on over its own pelt and strolled down among the sheep. The Lamb that belonged to the sheep, whose skin the Wolf was wearing, began to follow the Wolf in the Sheep’s clothing; so, leading the Lamb a little apart, he soon made a meal off her, and for some time he succeed-ed in deceiving the sheep, and enjoying hearty meals.Appearances are deceptive.","A Wolf found great difficulty in getting at the sheep owing to the vigilance of the shepherd and his dogs.

The Dog in the Manger,"A Dog looking out for its afternoon nap jumped into the Manger of an Ox and lay there cosily upon the straw. But soon the Ox, returning from its afternoon work, came up to the Manger and wanted to eat some of the straw. The Dog in a rage, being awakened from its slumber, stood up and barked at the Ox, and whenever it came near attempted to bite it. At last the Ox had to give up the hope of getting at the straw, and went away muttering:‘Ah, people often grudge others what they cannot enjoy themselves.’","A Dog looking out for its afternoon nap jumped into the Manger of an Ox and lay there cosily upon the straw.

The Man and the Wooden God,"In the old days men used to worship stocks and stones and idols, and prayed to them to give them luck. It happened that a Man had often prayed to a wooden idol he had re-ceived from his father, but his luck never seemed to change. He prayed and he prayed, but still he remained as unlucky as ever. One day in the greatest rage he went to the Wooden God, and with one blow swept it down from its pedestal. The idol broke in two, and what did he see? An immense number of coins flying all over the place.","In the old days men used to worship stocks and stones and idols, and prayed to them to give them luck.
