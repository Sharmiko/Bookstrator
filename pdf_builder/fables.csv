The Dog In the  Manger,"A Dog asleep in a manger filled with hay, was awakened by the Cattle, which came in tired and hungry from working in the field. But the Dog would not let them get near the manger, and snarled and snapped as if it were filled with the best of meat and bones, all for himself.

The Cattle looked at the Dog in disgust. ""How selfish he is!"" said one. ""He cannot eat the hay and yet he will not let us eat it who are so hungry for it!""

Now the farmer came in. When he saw how the Dog was acting, he seized a stick and drove him out of the stable with many a blow for his selfish behavior.

Do not grudge others what you cannot enjoy yourself.

The heron,"A Heron was walking sedately along the bank of a stream, his eyes on the clear water, and his long neck and pointed bill ready to snap up a likely morsel for his breakfast. The clear water swarmed with fish, but Master Heron was hard to please that morning.

""No small fry for me,"" he said. ""Such scanty fare is not fit for a Heron.""

Now a fine young Perch swam near.

""No indeed,"" said the Heron. ""I wouldn't even trouble to open my beak
for anything like that!""

As the sun rose, the fish left the shallow water near the shore and swam
below into the cool depths toward the middle. The Heron saw no more
fish, and very glad was he at last to breakfast on a tiny Snail.

Do not be too hard to suit or you may have to be content with the worst or with nothing at all.

The Eagle and the Arrow,"An Eagle was soaring through the air when suddenly it heard the whizz of an Arrow, and felt itself wounded to death. Slowly it fluttered down to the earth, with its life-blood pouring out of it.

Looking down upon the Arrow with which it had been pierced, it found that the shaft of the Arrow had been feathered with one of its own plumes. Alas! it cried, as it died,

""We often give our enemies the means for our own destruction.""
